🏥 Papollo Hospitals: Leads Flow Dashboard

An interactive healthcare analytics dashboard designed to track patient flow, billing trends, diagnosis patterns, and doctor feedback—streamlining hospital operations and improving care outcomes.

The Papollo Hospitals Leads Flow Dashboard provides a centralized view of patient admissions, discharges, diagnosis categories, billing amounts, and feedback volume per doctor. Built for hospital administrators and operations teams, this dashboard offers a data-driven lens to monitor hospital efficiency, resource utilization, and financial performance.

The dashboard was developed using the following technologies:

• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Core platform for creating data visualizations and interactivity.

• 🔄 Power Query – Used to clean, transform, and load patient and hospital records.

• 🔗 Data Modeling – Relationships established across date tables, patient data, diagnoses, and doctor feedback.

• 📁 File Format – .pbix for Power BI development; exported .png for dashboard snapshots.
